> **Live app: [v61-tier3-team-34.vercel.app](https://v61-tier3-team-34.vercel.app)**
> Upload a `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` job description (or paste it) and go straight from job posting to practice questions.

## 📌 Project Overview

### The Challenge

Empower job seekers with fast, personalized, and effective interview preparation by transforming any job description into tailored, role-specific practice questions.

### The Vision

Candidates waste time hunting for practice questions that don't even match the role they're applying for — when the job description itself already contains everything needed to prepare properly. DashFetch reads the responsibilities, required skills, and experience level from a JD and turns them into behavioral, technical, and experience-based questions that mirror what real interviewers ask.

```

> `/api/ingest` is a pure parsing/extraction route — it never talks to Groq. Structured extraction and question generation are separate steps (`/api/parse` and `/api/generate-questions`), each with its own prompt and schema.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| **Framework** | Next.js 15/16 (App Router) — full-stack: React frontend + API routes backend |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS, Plus Jakarta Sans & Inter |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| **AI Layer** | Groq — `llama-3.1-8b-instant` |
| **File parsing** | `pdf-parse` (PDF), `mammoth` (DOCX) |
| **Testing** | Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions — runs Vitest on every Pull Request |

> Next.js is full-stack on its own, so frontend and backend deploy together as a single Vercel project.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase project
- A Groq API key

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/V61-tier3-team-34.git
cd V61-tier3-team-34
```

### 2. Install & configure

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in Supabase + Groq credentials
```

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
```

> Never commit `.env.local` — it is already in `.gitignore`. Use `.env.example` as a reference.

Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor for your project to set up the database.

### 3. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the local dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run Vitest in watch mode |

---

## 📖 Usage

1. Open the [live app](https://v61-tier3-team-34.vercel.app) (or `http://localhost:3000` locally)
2. Upload a job description file, or paste the text directly
3. Select the number of questions per category (up to 5)
4. Review the extracted job data on the **Job Summary** screen
5. Browse generated **Technical / Behavioral / Experience** questions
6. Switch to **Mock Interview** mode to practice one question at a time

> ⏳ On first use after a period of inactivity, file-upload parsing may have a short cold-start delay — this is expected Vercel free-tier behavior.

---

## ⚙️ Groq Free-Tier Constraints

The Groq free tier's tokens-per-minute limit is a hard constraint the app is built around, not an edge case:

- Input text is truncated at **24,000 characters** before being sent to Groq
- The model was switched from `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` to **`llama-3.1-8b-instant`** specifically to stay within TPM limits
- Question generation uses **3 separate Groq calls** (one per category) to ensure the correct number of questions is returned

---

## 🛡️ Reliability & Resiliency

To handle Groq's free-tier limits and potential network hiccups, the backend implements a customized **Exponential Backoff with Jitter** retry framework and isolated database persistence callbacks.

👉 **[Read the full AI Services Documentation](./docs/ai-services.md)** for deep-dives into rate-limiting, retry formulas, and database resilience.

| Check | Tool | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit tests | Vitest | ✅ 70+ tests passing |
