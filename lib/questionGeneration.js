Generate EXACTLY ${quantityPerCategory} interview questions for EACH of the three categories below.
You MUST return ${quantityPerCategory} questions in "technical", ${quantityPerCategory} in "behavioral", and ${quantityPerCategory} in "experience".
Do not return fewer questions. Count carefully before responding.
- "technical": questions testing hands-on knowledge of the required tools, skills, and technologies.
- "behavioral": questions about how the candidate has handled past situations (teamwork, conflict, leadership, communication).
- "experience": questions probing the candidate's specific past experience relevant to this role's responsibilities and seniority.
Each question must include a concise sample answer (3-5 sentences) showing what a strong response looks like, written in first person as if the candidate is answering.
Return ONLY a single valid JSON object — no markdown fences, no commentary — matching exactly this shape:
{
  "technical": [{ "question": "", "sample_answer": "" }],
  "behavioral": [{ "question": "", "sample_answer": "" }],
  "experience": [{ "question": "", "sample_answer": "" }]
}
Each array must contain EXACTLY ${quantityPerCategory} objects. No more, no less.`;
